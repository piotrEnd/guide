**Information architecture:**

City guide needs online presence. Neither as simple as business card, nor complex as city to guide round. One-page-website fits here best: hero with aerial video catch attention and immediately communicate the field of expertise; next come few brand promises and short biographical note; then large testimonials; contact form is placed at the bottom.


**Design:**

The target audience are Germans therefore typography refers to german influences historically present and still visible in the city. Its about building confidence based upon perceived similarity. The whole content is kept short and to the point to avoid any unnecessary distractions.
